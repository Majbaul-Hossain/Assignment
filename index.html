                    You don’t have to let your pizza dough rise overnight – or up to 48 hours – in the refrigerator, but
                    if
                    you do, it will develop more flavor and air bubbles that will puff up when the pizza is cooked.
                    (Some
                    people fight over the slices with air bubbles.) Make sure to take the dough out of the refrigerator
                    an
                    hour before using it to bring it to room temperature.

                        Bread flour is the best flour for homemade pizza dough. You can use all-purpose flour instead of
                        the bread flour called for in the recipe, but bread flour is higher in gluten than all-purpose
                        flour and will make a crispier crust for your pizza.
